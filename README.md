# Interactive Avatar — Gesture Recognition POC
> An interactive avatar that responds to hand gestures in real-time using **MediaPipe** and **React**.

---

## 🖼️ Preview
A proof-of-concept interactive avatar system designed for retail displays that creates engaging customer experiences through real-time gesture recognition and responsive animations.

Live Demo: {Coming Soon} 🌐

---

## 🌱 What This Explores
- 🎥 **Real-time gesture detection** using **MediaPipe Tasks Vision** for webcam input
- 🤖 **Interactive avatar system** with personality-driven responses to customer gestures  
- 🎭 **State management** for idle, active, and defensive avatar behaviours
- ⚡ **Performance optimisation** for smooth real-time interactions on basic hardware
- 🏪 **Store-ready** design scalable for retail display environments

## 🎯 Gesture Mapping
- 👋 **Wave** → Avatar waves back enthusiastically
- 👍 **Thumbs Up** → Avatar gives thumbs up with happy expression  
- ✌️ **Peace Sign** → Avatar nods approvingly
- 👉 **Pointing** → Avatar acknowledges with friendly gesture
- 🖕 **Rude Gestures** → Avatar shows defensive posture, sad face
- 😴 **No Person** → Avatar enters idle/bored state with occasional yawns

---

## 🚧 Development Phases
- [x] **Phase 1**: Basic gesture detection + simple avatar responses
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Refined state machine + smooth animations
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Storefront demo + performance optimisation  
- [ ] **Phase 4**: AI-generated animations via advanced ML models
