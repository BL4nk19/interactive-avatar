Interactive Avatar project using MediaPipe hand gesture recognition.

CURRENT TECH STACK:
- React 18+ with TypeScript (Vite setup)
- @mediapipe/tasks-vision for gesture recognition
- Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
- Canvas API for real-time processing

PROJECT GOAL:
Build storefront avatar that:
- Detects customer gestures via webcam
- Responds with character animations  
- Shows idle states when no person detected
- Positive gestures → friendly responses
- Rude gestures → defensive reactions

ARCHITECTURE:
- components/avatar/ (avatar system)
- components/camera/ (webcam handling)
- hooks/ (React hooks for MediaPipe)
- types/ (TypeScript definitions)

Focus on modular, scalable code that can be extended with AI-generated animations later.
